# Football Scores
Project 3 pt 2 - Android Nanodegree

In this project, I productionized one of two apps, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. 
To do this, I found and handled error cases, added accessibility features, allowed for localization, and added widgets.

## Build/Install

## Components

Implemented:
* Added a widget to display the days football scores.

* Added support for layout mirroring.
